# Final-project

## Background

Producers pitch movie ideas to studios in hopes of making the next blockbuster, or movie theatres may need to know which film will have a higher probability of positive reception. Traditionally producing or hosting a blockbuster film was more art than science.
Our Machine Learning Program enables Producers to better assess and choose which films would be a success and which are likely to flop with greater confidence.
